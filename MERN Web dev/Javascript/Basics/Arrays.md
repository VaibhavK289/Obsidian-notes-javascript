Notes:

1. array declaration methods
	1. let array_name = '['array_elements']';
	2. let array_name = new array(array_elements);
2. We can use .push method to insert an element at last position in an array.
3. another way of adding an element in an array is: arrayName[arrayName.push] = elementToPush;
4. pop() method removes last element and also temporarily stores it value. Hence, it can be used to directly assign popped value to a variable.
5. copywithin method can be used to create a copy of an array.
6. Softcopy - directly references the memory and not the object from which it was copied.
