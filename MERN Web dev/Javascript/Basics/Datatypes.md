	-------------------------                            objects
	|String, Boolean, Number|                              |
	|null, undefined, symbol|              ----------------------------
	-------------------------             | arrays, function, objects |

Note: 
1. typeof() - this method can be used to find out the type of data inside a variable.
2. objects in javascript can be created using new keyword.
3. In javascript everything is an object.
4. Undefined = value exist but is not known.
5. null = value exist and its value is empty (or in many cases 0).
6. We can explicitly state a value to be undefined.
7. " `` " - is called a backtick.
8. String interapolation - we can use the syntax ` hello ${varible_name}` to use variables inside a string definition.
9. symbol() method can be used to define a symbol.
10. Symbols guarantees uniqueness and it can be used to add a unique property key.
11. We can access the properties inside an object by using a '.'.
12. if an object is defined as a constant then also we can change value of properties inside of that object because the memory block is same only the values are changing.
13. [" "] - this notation can also be used to access the members inside an object.
